## Story

*It has not yet been decided whether shinla is the name of the character or the characters mentor who seems to die in the beginning of the game.*

In the beginning of the game the character is training with their mentor when an attack occurs that puts the mentor in danger. Durring the attack the character decides to finally choose their first spell, light or dark, in order to defned their mentor. This decision sets them up on a path for the rest of the game on which skills they will be stronger in. The character is not succesful in saving their mentor and their mentor at the last second casts a spell to teleport the character away. The character wakes up in an open field where they must start their adventure.
